# SPiCy_wx
Silly tool to check if a location is in one of the SPC's outlooks

# Why does this exist?
I wanted to see if I could write a tool from scratch that can determine if a point is in a polygon. Using the various SPC outlooks seemed like a good candidate, as they let me tinker with some simple kml/xml stuff as well.
